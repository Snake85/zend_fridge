zend_fridge
===========

In Order to run the project:
- Download it from GitHub
- Set up a virtual host
- If you are NOT running it on Zend Server just add the latest Zend Framework 1 library on the folder "library" in the root of the project 

In the DOC folder you can find the json and csv file to test my application.

I tried to use as many different component in order to show you my ability
- w3c validation
- nice interface
- using Jquery
- zend layout
- zend view_helper
- zend_filter

I just bought my new MAC computer and I'm having some issues trying to install PHPUnit with Zend Server.
I will try to fix it in this weekend.

I'also available to refactor my code in order to use:
- zend_form
- OOP instead arrays
