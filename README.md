In Order to run the project:
- Download it from GitHub

I included in the project the Zend Framework 1 library like this the application is all-inclusive even if you will not run it under Zend Server.

In the DOC folder you can find the json and csv file to test my application.

I'also available to refactor my code in order to use:
