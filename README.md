zend_fridge
===========

In the DOC folder you can find the json and csv file to test my application.

I tried to use as many different component in order to show you my ability
- w3c validation
- nice interface
- using Jquery
- zend layout
- zend view_helper
- zend_filter

I'm just having problem unit testing my code and setting up a virtural host.
I just bought my new MAC computer and I'm having issue when I tried to install PHPUnit on Zend Server.
I will try to fix it in this weekend.

I'also available to refactor my code in order to use:
- zend_form
- OOP instead arrays
